The task was to create a method that compresses and decompresses a string. I have developed a mini project that demonstrates methods for compressing and decompressing a string. To view and test the project locally, you can clone the repository and install the required modules.

Additionally, I have hosted the app online on Netlify, and it is accessible via the following link:
